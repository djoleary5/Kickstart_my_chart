# Kickstart_my_chart
Using advanced Excel to organize and analyze data from Kickstarter campaigns.

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this project, I organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.


## Steps Taken

Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `state` column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.
